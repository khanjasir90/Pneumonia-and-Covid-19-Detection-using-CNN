# Pneumonia-and-Covid-19-detection-using-CNN
Radiology is the field of Medical Science where a disease is examined by interpreting X-Ray Images.As Human Intervention is involved it is pretty much prone to making an error.
So to overcome all this shortcomings DeepLearning approaches such as CNN has emerged as an answer.
So in this we have developed a System which predicts wherther a patient is Covid-19 affected or not based on X-ray Images and also provides visual outputs in the form of bargraphs.
